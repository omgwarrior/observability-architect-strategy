# Enterprise Observability Strategy

This repository outlines a scalable, vendor-neutral observability framework designed for cloud-native and hybrid environments. It includes instrumentation guides, alerting strategies, KPI dashboards, and a roadmap for enterprise adoption.

## Goals
- Achieve unified telemetry across metrics, logs, traces, and events
- Align observability with business KPIs and customer impact
- Enable automation, RCA, and self-healing capabilities
- Support multi-cloud scalability and OpenTelemetry standards

## Architecture Overview
- OpenTelemetry SDKs → Collector → Multi-backend export (New Relic, Splunk, Prometheus)
- Cloud-native stack: AWS EKS, Lambda, Fargate
- Correlation via trace IDs, enriched logs, and entity tagging
